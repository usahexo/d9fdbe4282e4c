This week, Wizards of the Coast announced a new Warlock subclass for 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons: The Iron Mountain Collection’s Half-Orc Warlock!

The Iron Mountain Collection is a set of supplementary materials for D&D that was released earlier this year. It’s designed to help DMs run games in the unforgiving mountain environment of Iron Mountain. This new Warlock subclass is based on one of the monsters from that setting: the Half-Orc!

The new Warlock subclass is called the Oath of Vengeful Fury. As the name suggests, it’s all about unleashing your fury on your enemies. Warlocks who swear this oath are relentless in their pursuit of vengeance, and they won’t stop until their enemies are destroyed.

The Oath of Vengeful Fury gives Warlocks some powerful new tools to help them achieve their goals. They gain access to a number of deadly spells, including Lightning Bolt and Fireball. They also gain a number of special abilities that allow them to deal more damage to their enemies. For example, they can use their power to temporarily increase their strength or speed, making them even more deadly in battle.

If you’re looking for a new Warlock subclass that lets you unleash your inner barbarian, then the Oath of Vengeful Fury is definitely worth checking out!

#  Chill, Recovering Gamer Warlock now available from the Iron Mountain Collection!

The Warlock in question, who goes by the name of Chill, was once a feared and brutal player in the online gaming community. He boasted an impressive win-loss record in team-based competitive games, and his skill with firearms, swords and sorcery was the stuff of legend.

Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. After years of mercilessly crushing the competition, Chill finally met his match in a particularly skilled opponent. In what would be his final match, Chill was soundly defeated, losing not only the game but also his dignity and composure.

Humiliated and disgraced, Chill abandoned his online gamer persona and sought refuge in the real world. It was during this time that he met and fell in love with a beautiful woman named Crystal. The two of them started a family and Chill put his previous life behind him.

But now, after years of peace and quiet, Chill has decided to dust off his old warlock armor and return to the online gaming scene. He's not out for revenge; instead, he just wants to show the world that he's still got what it takes to be the best.

You can find Chill now available from the Iron Mountain Collection!
