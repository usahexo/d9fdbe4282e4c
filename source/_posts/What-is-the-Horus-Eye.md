The Horus Eye was believed to have been created by the god Horus after he defeated the god Seth in a battle. The eye was intended to be a representation of Horus' victory over evil and chaos.

In ancient Egyptian culture, the Horus Eye was used as a funerary amulet. It was believed that the amulet would provide the deceased with protection and guide them through the afterlife. The amulet could also be used to protect against curses and bad luck.

#  Who is Kofi A. Annan and what does he have to do with Horus Eye?

Kofi Annan was the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 1997 to December 2006. Annan and the United Nations were jointly awarded the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize. He is a member of the Elders, a group of global leaders who work together on peace and human rights issues.

Annan was born in Kumasi, Ghana, and has siblings including his economist brother Kwame Anthony Appiah. After attending Presbyterian Boys’ Secondary School in Kumasi, he received a Rhodes scholarship to study at Oxford University. Thereafter, he attended the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, receiving a master's degree in public administration. In addition to his native Akan, Annan can speak English, French and Spanish.

Annan began his career at the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1966 as an information officer. He then moved to the UN Economic Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa in 1969 as Head of Personnel. From 1974 to 1976 he served as Deputy Director of Human Resources Management for the UN Secretariat in New York City. Subsequently he returned to Geneva to work for the WHO until 1981 when he became Director of Human Resources Development. In 1983 he was appointed Assistant Secretary-General for human resources management and promoted to Deputy Secretary-General two years later; becoming Chief of Staff in 1992.

In 1997 Kofi Annan was unanimously elected by the UN General Assembly to succeed Boutros Boutros-Ghali as Secretary-General. As Secretary-General, Annan brought together leading world figures for crises meeting on global warming, terrorism prevention, East Timor independence and Burundi/Rwanda genocide restoration efforts. He acted as an envoy for Kim Dae Jung's Sunshine Policy initiative and helped mediate between India and Pakistan after nuclear testing revelations rocked both nations circa 19981999 timeframe (Kashmir skirmishes would continue until 2004). In 2003 Annan proposed The Millennium Development Goals, eight humanitarian goals with specific targets to be reached by 2015, which was broadly accepted by world leaders and gives a benchmark against which progress can be measured. 

In 2004 allegations that an Iraqi company had bribed members of Saddam Hussein's government in order to secure contracts during the UN Oil-for-Food Programme led to investigations by several governments culminating in Kofi Annan's 2005 indictment by Iraqi authorities for corruption; though charges were eventually dropped due to lack of evidence. The same year he also faced criticism from conservative groups and media outlets after making statements that U.S.-led invasions of Iraq were "illegal." 
After two successive five year terms as Secretary General Kofi Annan stepped down from his role on 31 December 2006 coinciding with reforms intended to give the Security Council more control over the appointment process; notably veto power resting with regional blocs rather than established great powers alone.. On 16 September 2013, Kofi Annan became Co-Chairman of The Elders with Gro Harlem Brundtland.[2]

On 18 March 2018 Kofi Annan passed away peacefully after a short illness aged 80.]]
