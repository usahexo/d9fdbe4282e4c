#  Kofi Annan Names Opening Date for Delaware Recreation Area Casino

Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary-general, has announced the opening date for the Delaware Recreation Area Casino. The $4.5 billion facility will open its doors to the public on July 4th and is expected to create thousands of jobs in the area.

The casino is a key part of Governor Jack Markell's plan to revitalize the Delaware economy. In addition to creating jobs, the casino is expected to generate over $200 million in annual tax revenue.

"The Delaware Recreation Area Casino will be a major attraction for visitors and residents alike," said Annan. "I'm proud to be involved in such an important project."

Construction on the casino began in 2014 and has been plagued by delays and cost overruns. But officials say that the final product will be worth the wait.

"This casino is going to be unlike anything else in Delaware," said Markell. "It will be a world-class facility that will create jobs and stimulate our economy."

#  Delaware Recreation Area Casino opening delayed

The opening of the new Delaware Recreation Area Casino has been delayed. The casino is a $400 million development that was expected to open in early 2019. However, the opening has been pushed back to late 2019 or early 2020.

The delay is due to the need for more construction work on the project. The casino will feature a gaming floor, 9 restaurants, a spa, and a rooftop pool. It is being built on the grounds of the former Delaware Raceway Park.

Delaware officials say that the delay will not have a significant impact on the state's economy. They expect that the casino will create 2,000 jobs and generate over $100 million in annual revenue.

#  Delaware Recreation Area Casino construction continues on schedule

The Delaware Recreation Area Casino is scheduled to open in July of this year, according to the Delaware River and Bay Authority. The project is currently on schedule and remains on budget.

The new casino will be a major boon to the area, creating hundreds of jobs and generating millions of dollars in revenue for the state. It will also attract tourists from all over the region, boosting the local economy.

The casino is being built on a former industrial site that has been cleaned up and redeveloped. The project has received a $10 million grant from the state, which will help finance construction of a new bridge that will connect the casino to the rest of the recreation area.

"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us," said authority CEO Thomas Cook. "We're excited to bring this world-class facility to our region."

The casino will feature 1,000 slot machines, 33 table games, and a full-service restaurant. It will also include a hotel with 100 rooms, as well as conference and banquet facilities.

Construction of the casino is ongoing but proceeding according to schedule. Visitors to the recreation area can expect to see a lot of progress in the coming weeks and months.
