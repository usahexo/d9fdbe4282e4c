#  How Does Game Casino Francis Ford Coppola Stand Out?

Casino is a 1995 American epic crime film directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone, and Joe Pesci. It is based on the non-fiction book Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas by Nicholas Pileggi, who also co-wrote the screenplay for the film with Scorsese.

The film chronicles the rise and fall of mob associate Sam "Ace" Rothstein (De Niro) and his casino empire. Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal (Pesci), a member of the Chicago Outfit, serves as the film's narrator.

Scorsese initially declined to direct the film because he saw it as documentation of gangster life that he did not want to glorify. However, he changed his mind after reading Pileggi's book. He cast Pesci in the lead role because he believed that Pesci could make the character sympathetic. 

Prior to its release, Casino was heavily criticized by the Italian-American Anti-Defamation League, who claimed that it would reopen old wounds. The group also asked Paramount Pictures to withdraw advertising for the film that featured a stereotypical Italian-American pizza maker.

The film was finally released on November 22, 1995, and was a box office success. It grossed $42 million domestically in its opening weekend and went on to earn $116 million in total North American receipts, against a budget of $55 million. It received mostly positive reviews from critics; however, their praise was somewhat muted by their disappointment with Scorsese's handling of the end result.

The cast was praised, particularly De Niro's performance which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Pesci also received a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. In 1998, Casino was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". 

Arthur Goldberg (a producer of Casino) stated in an interview that it took three years to convince Scorsese to make Casino because Scorsese wanted to focus on other projects at first (such as Bringing out the Dead). But once Matt Damon came up with the idea of basing it on Goodfellas (which had impressed Scorsese immensely), things started moving quickly. 

# The Making of Casino 

In 1993, Nicholas Pileggi wrote a book about his professional relationship with casino owner Frank Rosenthal, called Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family,[4] which covered Rosenthal's life as a Mafia associate turned Las Vegas casino boss.[5] After meeting with Martin Scorsese about adapting Pileggi's non-fiction book into a feature film project,[6] Pileggi decided instead to write a new fictionalized screenplay specifically about Rosenthal.[7] Because of this switch, producer Martin Bregman argued that Pileggi should receive co-writing credit for the screenplay.[5] To keep within production costs,[8] Scorcesse filmed much of Casino near its actual location in Las Vegas[9][10] and at other locations in California such as Los Angeles[11][12], San Francisco[13][14], and San Quentin State Prison.[15]. During production meetings Scorcesse shown DeNiro and Pesci video clips from such movies like Once Upon A Time In America and The Godfather Part II as visual references for their performances in Casino[16]. Three months prior to shooting Pesci visited Gary Basey at Folsom prison – where Basey was serving time on drug charges – to study Basey’s mannerisms so he could better portray Rossi accurately[17]. Filming began on March 1st 1994[18] ended on July 22 1994[19], having shot celluloid footage amounting to 137 minutes rather than its desired 150 minutes before post production took place . 

Upon release both Elizabeth Weitzman from New York Daily News and Roger Ebert from Chicago Sun Times gave 4 out 5 star reviews ; praising performances given but criticizing what they felt were cardboard cutout characters belonging solely to exposition scenes rather than integrated throughout story itself [20][21]. The Daily News review pointed out inconsistency issues arising from mixing fact & fiction together -themes explored earlier dealt primarily with Mafia association dealings gambling instead became backdrop allowing expression Scarcese personal grievances , concluding “What might have been an important examination of power relationships instead becomes an essayistic luxury item” - whereas Ebert felt sympathy towards leading man while dismissing Sharon stone’s femme fatale whose actions didnt seem clear or motivated until very end [22]. Nevertheless , upon release movie grossed 52 million dollars over Memorial Day weekend alone playing at only 720 theaters nationwide causing Universal Pictures executives dub it an "unqualified hit".[23]Despite mixed critical response upon release Robert De Niro’s portrayal earned him an Academy Award nomination for
