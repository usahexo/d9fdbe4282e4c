#  How does the casino Tofaş baccarat game work?

Baccarat is one of the casino games that fascinate many people with its simple rules but great potential for winning. Tofaş is one of the versions of this game, and let's see how it works.

The game is played with eight decks of cards, and the player and banker are dealt two cards each. The aim of the game is to get as close as possible to nine points. The points are counted from the two cards, with face values counting as their respective points, for example an Ace equals 1 point and a 2 equals 2 points. If the player or banker has an 8 or 9 then no more cards are drawn - this is called a 'natural' - and they immediately win. If neither player nor banker has an 8 or 9 then the third card is drawn and its value is added to the other two cards to work out the points total.

The player can choose to either stand (stick with what they have) or take another card; if they take another card and this puts them over nine then their original total is subtracted from nine to find their actual points total (so for example 10 becomes 1). The banker always stands on a 6 hand (or any hand totalling 7 or more).

The winner is the person with the highest points total; if both players have the same total then it's a draw. In Tofaş baccarat, you can bet on either player or banker winning, or you can bet that it will be a draw - there are also various other side bets that can be made.

#  What are the basic rules of baccarat?

The basic rules of baccarat are fairly simple, but there are a few things to remember. The aim of the game is to get as close to 9 as possible. Cards 2-9 are worth face value, while 10s and aces are worth 0. If you get two cards that add up to 9 or more, you ‘bust’ and your bet is lost.

The player and banker each draw two cards and the highest total wins. If both players have the same total, it’s a draw and no one wins. In some versions of the game, the player can also choose to ‘stand’ on their current total rather than taking another card.

You can bet on either the player or the banker (or a tie), and you can also bet on whether there will be a ‘natural’ (an un-busted hand of 9 or more). Bets on the player or banker pay even money, while bets on a natural pay out at 3-2.
