#  IRS Urges Taxpayers to Report Gambling Winnings

The Internal Revenue Service is urging taxpayers who have won big gambling prizes to report the income on their tax returns.

“Gambling winnings are taxable and must be reported on your tax return,” said IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. “Be sure to include all of your gambling winnings, whether from lotteries, raffles, horse races or casinos.”

Koskinen warned taxpayers that they may not be able to deduct their losses from their winnings.

“The rules for deducting gambling losses are very specific and can be tricky, so be sure to speak with a tax professional if you have any questions,” he said.

The IRS has outlined the following guidelines for gambling income:

-Gambling income includes, but is not limited to, money won from games of chance, lotteries, raffles and poker tournaments.
-You must report all gambling income on your federal tax return, even if you do not receive a Form W2-G showing the amount of the payout. 
-You cannot deduct gambling losses from your gambling income. 
-Gambling income is taxable regardless of whether you itemize deductions or take the standard deduction. 
-Income earned from illegal activities such as drug trafficking is also included in gambling income.

#  Don't Forget to Report Your Gambling Winnings

If you hit it big playing the horses, slots, or poker, don't forget to report your gambling winnings on your tax return. You must report all gambling winnings as income on your federal tax return.

Gambling Winnings

In order to accurately report your gambling winnings, you first need to know what qualifies as gambling income. Gambling income includes not only the money you win, but also cash and the fair market value of any non-cash prizes you receive. For example, if you win a $5,000 car in a casino raffle, the fair market value of the car would be included in your gambling income.

Reporting Gambling Winnings

You report your gambling income on line 21 of your federal tax return. Generally, you will use Form 1040EZ if your gambling income is less than $5,000. If your gambling income is more than $5,000, then you will need to use Form 1040A or Form 1040. You will also need to complete Schedule A and attach it to your return if you itemize deductions.

There are a few exceptions to reporting gambling winnings on your taxes. Some of these exceptions include:
- amounts won from lotteries and raffles
- the value of any prizes won in a contest that is not entered into for profit
- most awards and prizes received as part of employment (e.g., an employee winning a prize in a company lottery)

#  Are You Missing Out on a Tax Deduction? 

Are you a homeowner? If so, you may be able to take a tax deduction for some of the money you spend on your home. The amount of the deduction will depend on how much money you spend on qualifying home improvements.

In order to qualify for the deduction, your home must be used as your main residence. You must also itemize your deductions on your income tax return. And finally, the improvements must meet certain requirements.

The most common types of home improvements that qualify for a tax deduction are those that increase the value of your home or that improve its energy efficiency. Some examples of eligible improvements include adding insulation, replacing windows, and installing a new roof.

If you make any of these or other qualifying improvements, you can deduct the costs on Schedule A of your federal income tax return. The amount that you can deduct will depend on how much the improvement increases the value of your home and when you made the improvement.

For example, if you add insulation to your attic and it increases the value of your home by $1,000, you can deduct $500 (50% of the cost) on Schedule A. If you make an energy-efficient improvement such as replacing an old heating system with a new one, you may be able to deduct the entire cost of the improvement.

Be sure to talk to your tax advisor about which home improvements qualify for a tax deduction and what restrictions may apply. Taking advantage of this deduction can help reduce your taxable income and save you some money come tax time!

#  Report All Your Gambling Winnings and Losses This Year

As the end of the year approaches, it's time to start thinking about your taxes. While most people think about their income and deductions, you may also need to report your gambling winnings and losses.

If you've been visiting the casino, or playing poker or lottery tickets, you need to track all of your gambling winnings and losses so that you can properly report them on your tax return. This includes money won and lost from both casual and professional gambling activities.

Gambling income is taxable, and you must report it on your tax return. The good news is that you can deduct your gambling losses from your taxable income, which can help reduce your tax bill. However, you can only deduct losses up to the amount of your gambling income for the year.

You should also keep track of any expenses related to gambling, such as travel expenses, food, lodging, etc. These costs can be deducted from your gambling income as well.

So how do you report all this information on your tax return? It's actually quite simple. You just need to complete Form 1040 Schedule A, Section B - Gambling Winnings and Losses. This form asks for all the pertinent information regarding your gambling activities over the year. You will list your winnings and losses separately, as well as any expenses related to gambling.

It's important to note that you must include any taxable gambling winnings in your total income for the year. This means that they will be subject to applicable taxes, such as federal income tax, state income tax, and in some cases local income tax. So make sure to factor in any taxes that may apply when filing your taxes this year.
