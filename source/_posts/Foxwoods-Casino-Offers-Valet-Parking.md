#  Foxwoods Casino Adds 1,000 New Parking Spaces

The Foxwoods Resort Casino recently announced the addition of 1,000 new parking spaces to its already massive parking lot. The new space is in addition to the 4,500 spaces that are already available, making a total of 5,500 parking spots.

Foxwoods is expecting the additional parking to help ease traffic congestion and improve customer experience. In a statement, Lubin termed the announcement an important milestone for Foxwoods and its guests.
