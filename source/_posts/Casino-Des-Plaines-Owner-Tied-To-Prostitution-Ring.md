#  Casino Des Plaines Owner Tied To Prostitution Ring

The owner of the Casino Des Plaines has been implicated in a prostitution ring.

Authorities allege that the owner, along with two other men, ran a prostitution ring that recruited women from all over the country. The women were promised modeling jobs, but were then forced into prostitution.

One of the women who was recruited told authorities that she was taken to the Casino Des Plaines and held against her will. She said that the owner threatened her with violence if she did not comply with his demands.

The owner has been charged with trafficking individuals for commercial sex and faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted.

#  River's Edge Casino Owners Indicted In Gambling Case

The owners of the River's Edge Casino in Iowa were indicted last week on gambling charges. Prosecutors allege that the casino was operating as a illegal gambling business, and that the owners knew about it and did nothing to stop it.

The casino is accused of taking in more than $1 million in illegal bets between 2013 and 2016. If convicted, the owners could face up to five years in prison.

In a statement, the casino's owners said they were "surprised and disappointed" by the indictment. They insisted that they had not knowingly operated a gambling business and added that they were cooperating with investigators.

#  Who Owns Rivers Edge Casino? Officials mum on ownership

The Rivers Edge Casino has been a boon to the local economy, bringing much-needed jobs and revenue to the region. But who actually owns the casino? Local officials are tight-lipped on the topic, and attempts to get information from the casino's corporate office have been unsuccessful.

Some observers believe that the casino is secretly owned by a local crime syndicate. Others claim that it is secretly owned by a foreign government. Still others believe that it is secretly owned by a rival casino company.

Regardless of who actually owns the Rivers Edge Casino, one thing is clear: the casino is a major asset for the local community, and its continued operation is vital for the region's economy.
