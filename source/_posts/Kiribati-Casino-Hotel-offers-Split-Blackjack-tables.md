#  Kiribati now offers Split Blackjack - how do you play?

If you're visiting the beautiful Pacific island nation of Kiribati, be sure to check out their new Split Blackjack game - it's a lot of fun! Here's how to play:

Split Blackjack is similar to traditional blackjack, but with a few twists. The game is played with six decks of cards, and the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. You can hit, stand, double down, or split your cards as usual. However, there are a few special rules that apply when splitting:

- If you split a pair of Aces, you get two more cards and one final chance to split again (unless you bust).

- If you split a pair of 10s or higher, the card values are split (so each card is worth 10 points instead of 20).

- If you split a pair of 8s or lower, the card values are not split (so each card is worth 8 points).

- You can only split once per hand.

The best way to learn how to play Split Blackjack is by playing it! Kiribati offers free gameplay at all of its casinos - so be sure to give it a try next time you're in the country.

#  How to Split in Blackjack - Kiribati Casino Hotel Style

When playing blackjack in Kiribati casino hotel style, the goal is to split as many times as possible to increase your chances of winning. There are a few basic rules you need to follow in order to split properly:

- You can only split cards of the same rank. For example, if you are dealt two 8s, you can split them into two separate hands.

- Aces can be split either once or twice, depending on the situation. If you are dealt an ace and a 2, for example, you can either split the ace and play one hand with a total of 3, or split the ace again and play two hands with totals of 1 each.

- You cannot re-split cards if they have already been split. For example, if you are dealt two aces and then split them into two separate hands, you cannot put them back together again.

- You must place an equal bet on each hand that is created by splitting cards. For example, if you split two 8s and end up with two hands worth $10 each, you must bet $20 in total - $10 on each hand.

Once you have followed these basic rules and placed your bets, it's time to start playing! The aim of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. In Kiribati casino hotel style, this is usually done by taking a mix of hits and stands according to your own cards and the dealer's up card. For more information on when to hit or stand in different situations, consult one of our strategy guides or ask one of our dealers at the table.

#  Tips for Splitting in Kiribati Casino Hotel's Version of Blackjack

There are a few things to think about when splitting in Blackjack. The main thing to remember is whether you have a good chance of winning the hand. If your first two cards are an 8 and a 3, for example, splitting them would give you two new cards - a king and a five. This would give you a total of 16, which is still lower than the dealer's total of 17. In this case, it's probably not worth splitting the hand because you're not likely to win.

However, if you have two aces, splitting them would give you two new cards - two more eights, for example. This would give you a total of 18, which is higher than the dealer's total of 17. In this case, splitting the hand would be a good idea because you have a better chance of winning.

When deciding whether or not to split, also think about what other cards are showing on the table. If there are lots of low cards (2s through 6s) out there, for example, then it might be wise to split your high cards (aces through eights) to try and get some low cards as well. However, if there are lots of high cards out there (10s through kings), then it might be best to keep your high cards together.

Another thing to keep in mind when splitting is whether or not to double down after splitting. Doubling down means that you double your bet and receive just one more card. If you have two sixes, for example, doubling down would give you three cards in total - one six and two twos. This would give you a total of 18, same as if you had split your sixes. However, if you have two fives instead of sixes, doubling down after splitting would not be the best move because your new card would only be a five - giving you a total of 10 which is still lower than the dealer's total of 17.

As with most things in life, blackjack requires some strategic thinking if you want to come out ahead!

#  Kiribati Casino Hotel adds split option to blackjack tables

Amid protests by some of the island's residents, the Kiribati Casino Hotel has announced that it will add a split option to its blackjack tables. This new feature, which will be available to guests as of October 1, 2018, will allow players to split their cards and play two hands simultaneously.

The decision to add the split option was made in response to feedback from casino guests, who have long requested the ability to split their cards. "We're always looking for ways to improve our guest experience," said hotel spokesperson Rebecca Stevens. "And we know that many of our guests enjoy playing blackjack, so we wanted to give them the option to split their cards."

Not everyone is happy about the decision, however. Some residents argue that the addition of the split option will lead to more gambling and excessive spending by casino guests. "This is just going to encourage people to gamble more money than they can afford," said one resident. "It's a bad idea."

Others argue that the split option will help boost tourism on the island. "People who come to Kiribati want to experience everything that our country has to offer," said one tourist. "And now, with this new split option, they can also enjoy playing blackjack while they're here."
