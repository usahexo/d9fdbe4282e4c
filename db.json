They are the bread and butter of chart reading and can help you to identify trendlines, support and resistance levels, chart patterns and more. Learning how to read these signals will help you to make informed trading decisions.\n\n1) The first signal is a move above or below a moving average. When a stock moves above or below its moving average, it is said to be in an uptrend or downtrend, respectively.\n\n2) The second signal is when a stock breaks out of a chart pattern. A breakout occurs when a stock moves past a defined level of support or resistance.\n\n3) The third signal is when a stock tests a support or resistance level. A stock that tests a support or resistance level is likely to break out soon.\n\n4) The fourth signal is when a security forms a trendline. A trendline can be used to identify the overall trend of a security and also to measure any changes in momentum.\n\n5) The fifth signal is when a security gaps up or down. Gaps indicate that something important has happened in the stock, such as the release of positive or negative news.\n\n6) The sixth signal is volume divergence. Volume divergence occurs when the volume of a security diverges from the price action, typically indicating that a change in momentum is taking place.\n\n7) The seventh signal is when RSI crosses over 50%. This indicates that the stock has become overbought (in an uptrend) or oversold (in a downtrend).\n\n8) The eighth signal is when Stochastics cross over 20%. This usually indicates that the security is close to being overbought or oversold.\n\n9) The ninth signal is MACD divergence. MACD divergence occurs when the MACD line diverges from the price action, typically indicating that a change in momentum is taking place.\n\n10) The tenth and final signal is candlestick patterns. Candlestick patterns are one of the oldest forms of technical analysis and can provide insight into whether buyers or sellers are in control of the market\n\n#  What do they indicate?\n\nWhat are some common computer system errors and what do they indicate?\n\nOne of the most common errors that people see on their computers is the Blue Screen of Death, or BSOD. This error will usually appear when Windows detects a serious problem with its system. The exact cause of the error can be difficult to determine, but it could be due to a variety of different factors, such as hardware issues, software problems, or viruses.\n\nAnother common error message is the \"Windows not Genuine\" message. This indicates that your copy of Windows may not be authentic, and you may need to purchase a valid license in order to continue using it.\n\nIf you receive an \"Error Code: 0x0000001E\" message, this typically means that there was a problem with your computer's hardware. You may need to replace certain components in order to resolve this issue.\n\nIf you see an \"Error code: 0xc0000005\" message, this typically means that there was a problem with one of your applications or with your system files. Try reinstalling the application or restoring your system files to resolve this issue.\n\n#  What can they help you identify and judge in football players?\n\nFootball skills are often judged and identified by their physical features. Most of these features can be seen and judged through height, weight, body shape and muscle mass. While football is a physical game that relies on these aspects, it’s not the only criteria that should be used to decide a player’s ability.\n\nHeight is one of the first things that people look for when judging football players. Height gives an advantage in some areas of the game such as winning aerial battles or being able to play in defensive positions. However, being tall doesn’t guarantee success as there have been many successful short footballers throughout the years. \n\nWeight is another physical attribute that can be judged in football players. Too much weight can be a disadvantage as it can slow down players, making them easier to tackle or block. But having a good amount of weight can give players an advantage in terms of strength and tackling ability. \n\nLooking at a player's body shape can also help identify their playing style. Players with a stocky build are often seen as being more physical and better suited for playing in defence. While players with a leaner frame are often considered to be more agile and better suited for playing in midfield or attack. \n\nLastly, muscle mass is another physical attribute that can be judged in footballers. Players with large amounts of muscle mass are often seen as being strong and powerful. Which can be an advantage when competing for the ball or attacking defences. However, too much muscle mass can also slow players down and make them less agile. \n\nWhile physical features are important, they should not be the only criteria used to judge football players. There are many other factors such as intelligence, creativity and skill that contribute to a player's ability on the pitch. So don't forget to look beyond these physical attributes when assessing a footballer's potential.\n\n#  How accurate are they in judging players?\n\nIt is often said that computers are great at judging players and making decisions based on their performances. But how accurate are they in reality?\n\nThere have been a few studies done to try and answer this question, with mixed results. In one study, it was found that while human experts were able to outperform a computer when it came to judgments about player abilities, the computer was better at predicting the outcomes of future matches.\n\nHowever, other studies have shown that computers are actually not very good at judging players at all. One such study found that computers were only able to correctly predict the outcomes of around 30% of matches, while human experts were able to do so around 60% of the time.\n\nSo what is the reason for these varied results? It seems likely that part of the problem is that computers don’t take into account all of the factors that humans do when making judgments about players. For example, emotions and psychology can play a big role in how well someone performs in a game, something which computers are not currently able to take into account.\n\nIn addition, humans also tend to have more experience than computers when it comes to assessing players, as they have been watching and analyzing games for many years. This experience allows them to notice things that a computer may not be able to see, such as small details in someone’s playing style or strategy.\n\nDespite these limitations, it is clear that computer judgments about players are becoming increasingly important in modern day sport. Many professional teams now use computers to help them scout new talent and make decisions about who to sign and drop from their team.\n\n#  When were they developed?\n\nThe first modern computers were developed in the early 1940s. They were huge, expensive, and used vacuum tubes.\n\nIn 1945, John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry designed the first electronic computer, called the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC). However, the ABC was not actually built until 1973.\n\nIn 1951, Konrad Zuse designed and built the first programmable computer.\n\nIn 1948, Maurice Wilkes designed the first stored program computer. The EDVAC was built in 1949.\n\nIn 1952, Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce invented the integrated circuit, which is the basis for modern computer chips.","source":"_posts/What-are-the-10-signals.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What are the 10 signals\ndate: 2022-08-17 18:31:33\ncategories:\n- Football Analysis\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What are the 10 signals?\n\nThe 10 signals are probably the most important aspect of technical analysis.
